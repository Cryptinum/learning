1. Planning for the project

	Always trying to prepare a plan before making a relatively large project.

	In the project 'Alien Invasion', we are aiming to implement these functions:

	Control:
	 - Controlling a rocket ship that appears at the bottom-center of the screen.
	 - Player can move the ship LEFT and RIGHT using the arrow keys.
	 - Player can press space bar to let the ship shoot bullet.
	
	Game start:
	 - A fleet of aliens fill the sky and moves across and down the screen.
	 - Players must shoot and destroy the aliens.
	 - If the player shoot all the aliens, a new fleet of aliens appears and move faster.

	Game ending:
	 - If any alien hits the player's ship or reach the bottom of the screen,
	   player will lose a ship.
	 - After losing 3 ships, the game ends.

2. Splitting the project into small pieces

	Rocket ship system - shooting bullets
	Alien system - alien generation and renew
	Scoring system - counting and calculating

3. Rocket ship system

	The rocket will be fixed at the bottom of the screen.
	Rocket can move left or right by pressing arrow key.
	Rocket should be restricted in the screen.
	Rocket can shoot fixed amount of bullets at the same time by pressing space bar.
	Bullets should disappear after moving out of the screen.
